This project is hopefully the first of many as I get ready for summer internship after studying 2 years of Computer Science at UOA.
This first project was more of me shaking off the rust as I took an extended vacation to Japan and Korea.
I could improve on this current project by adding GUI but I am currently satisfied with the current build.
Maybe I'll come back later to improve it.
